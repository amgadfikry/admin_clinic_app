### Introduction
Clinic Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management of medical clinics, offering features for both administrators and users. The project consists of a backend built with Flask and SQLAlchemy for database management, providing a secure API with authentication using hashed passwords and tokens. The front end is developed using React and Tailwind CSS, offering an admin panel for clinic management and a patient-user dashboard.

### Admin Panel Features:
- Manage specialties, doctors, offers
- Control appointments and testimonials/reviews
- Create dates for doctor appointments

### User Dashboard Features:
- Search for doctors by name or specialty
- Make, modify, and view appointments
- Update profile settings
- Add testimonials and reviews

### The Story
The inspiration behind the project came from the challenges faced by me as a physiotherapist in managing both the clinic and its online presence. The clinic app aims to simplify the digital presence of medical service providers, making clinic and record management efficient.
